# library-js

## Description
This is my third project within the Full Stack JavaScript course within The Odin Project, marking the start of my coursework within the JavaScript chapter of the course. This course will help me continue to learn new skills and techniques in JavaScript, building upon the basics I've learned in the Foundations Course. This project helped me practice using a new skill in object constructors, and challenged me once again to implement learned skills in DOM Manipulation, array methods, and scope. 

I chose, as I will with future projects in this course, to style this project using skills practiced in previous courses and parts of my career, including grid and flexbox layouts, relative units, and the CSS var() function.
